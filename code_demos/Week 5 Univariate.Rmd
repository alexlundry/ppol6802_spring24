Today we'll be learning how to create visualizations in R and ggplot2 of univariate data. For this demonstration we will be using the [Global Power Plant Database](https://datasets.wri.org/dataset/globalpowerplantdatabase). Please go to the URL and download the data, and place it in an accessible directory. Then open a new R script, load the libraries you'll be using and read the data into your R environment. Here's how you can do that:

```{r}
# load necessary library
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)

# load data
# the code below assumes that I put the file in 
# a folder called "datasets" that is in my working directory
# d1 <- read_csv("datasets/global_power_plant_database_v_1_3/global_power_plant_database.csv") 
# if you did not, then you will have to type out the full path, something like this:
d1 <- read_csv("datasets/global_power_plant_database_v_1_3/global_power_plant_database.csv")
```

## Dataset Overview

The first thing you should be doing with any dataset is exploring it. You've no doubt already covered some of the basics of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) in your Quant courses. But this is a visualization course, so let's consider how visualization can help. In fact, many of the univariate plots we will make today will be directly helpful as an exploratory tool.

Remember the two quotes we've previously discussed about the usefulness of visualization to EDA:

> "The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see." - John Tukey 

> "Getting information from a table is like extracting sunbeams from a cucumber." \~ Arthur & Henry Farquhar

We'll begin with three basic commands that don't quite qualify formally as data visualization, but they certainly enable you to see the data more easily:

-   the tidyverse's `glimpse` function.
-   base R's `head` function
-   base R's `View` function

Each of these can be used to better understand what the data looks like. First, `glimpse` provides us with a succinct look at the row and column count, each variable and it's corresponding type, and a brief look at the first few observations. Here it is for the powerplant dataset:

```{r}
glimpse(d1)
```

We immediately see that the dataset has 34,936 rows and 36 columns (variables). We see the type of variables (character, double, logical, etc), and the first few rows of each variable.

Of course, sometimes you just want to literally look at the data, you can do this a couple different ways. First, you can use `head()` to display the first few records in the R console. It defaults to the first 5 if you don't provide an `n =` parameter, but let's show it in action here:

```{r}
head(d1, n = 10) # you don't need the n parameter; it defaults to n = 5
```

You can also call the `View()` function, which opens the data in a new R Studio tab in a format that mimics a typical spreadsheet, in which you can sort and filter. I find this to be very helpful.

```{r}
# I've commented out the View code call just because it screws things up 
# when you're in an R markdown file, which is what this is.  
# View(gapminder_unfiltered)
```

But, given that this is a visualization course, there is a more visual way to get an overview of the data. I've found the `visdata` package to be an extraordinarily useful tool to help me "see" the big picture of large datasets:

```{r}
# you'll need to uncomment the code below and run it in order to install this package
# if you're wondering why it looks different for this package, it's because this 
# isn't yet on the official R site, so we need to install it directly from github
# we can only do this using a function called install_github that is part of a 
# package called "devtools."  In fact, you will have to install the devtools package
# first in order to do this.

# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("ropensci/visdat")
library(visdat)
```

In the `visdat` package the eponymous function is the most useful. Below we call `vis_dat` but we are first piping a smaller dataset into it. If we had just given it the full dataset it would throw an error and tell us the dataset is too big and needs to be sampled:

```{r}
d1 %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 10000) %>% 
  vis_dat()
```

It visualizes the data set, showing where there is missing data and the types of variables it has. Notice how it shows you that there are some SIZEABLE gaps in the data. Looks like the generation data varies by the year.

## Filtering the Data

With this information, let's pare down the dataset to something a little more manageable for this class session. We'll filter to just the year 2019, and power plants in the United States and we'll select just a few key variables that look interesting and helpful. We can do this using `dplyr` filter calls and saving this to a new dataset, named d2:

```{r}
d2 <- d1 %>% 
  filter(country == "USA", 
         year_of_capacity_data == 2019) %>% 
  select(country:primary_fuel, commissioning_year:year_of_capacity_data, generation_gwh_2019)

glimpse(d2)
```

## Visualizing One Categorical Variable

The most basic visualization task you will undertake will be the visualization of just one variable - especially if it is a straightforward categorical variable. Imagine, for example, visualizing the gender distribution of a dataset. You'll have only a few different values to visualize!

First, let's just remind ourselves which categorical variables we have in the dataset to work with. The code below lists the names of columns in the dataframe that are of the "character" data type. We don't need to dig into this deeply, but it's helpful to know:

`sapply()` is a function that applies a specific function over a vector.
`class()` tells us the type of variable.
`names()` will give us the variable names of a dataset.
`[]` the brackets allows us to select specific parts of a vector.

The statement below essentially says:

1)  For each of the variables in s2 (sapply)
2)  check to see if the class is equal to character (class == "character")
3)  if it is a character, then return the name of the variable (names(d2)[])

```{r}
names(d2)[sapply(d2, class) == "character"]
```

Looks like `primary_fuel` is our most interesting and useful one here. Let's take a look at it's values and get a sense for the data we'd like to display. We can do this by calling tidyverse's `count` function, and asking it to sort the data descending by that count:

```{r}
count(d2, primary_fuel, sort = T)
```

We have 14 values of `primary_fuel` with Solar, Gas, Hydro and Wind being the most common values. This is a great start to making our first visualization.

### Bar Charts

The most basic visualization we can make for one categorical variable would be to display the count of `primary_fuel` as a bar. But because it is the most basic, that means it is highly versatile and one of the most frequently used! As such, we are going to go into great detail on this. It's easy to make a bar chart, but improving it can get quite complex! So let's dig in here - we'll start simple and then add complexity step-by-step until we have an extremely robust bar chart.

To begin, remember your ggplot syntax! The only required items are:

-   **data**, for which we will assign `d2`
-   **aesthetic**, assigned here to `primary_fuel`
-   **geom**, we are doing a bar

Now take a look at how we slot this into the ggplot call below - notice that we are NOT explicitly declaring either the dataset or the X aesthetic mapping here (remember that ggplot is really good at understanding what you mean).

```{r}
ggplot(d2, aes(primary_fuel)) +
  geom_bar()
```

A good start, thanks to ggplot's sensible defaults! But there are many ways we can improve this, so let's get to it. First, and most obviously, let's give these bars a meaningful sort, preferably in order of the number of instances in the data.

How do we do this? Well, we could "bake an apple pie from scratch" OR we could use an easily accessible function, in this case, a tidyverse function called `fct_infreq()` which automatically turns categorical variables into a factor (a special data type in R), that is put in descending order based on its frequency in the dataset.

```{r}
ggplot(d2, aes(x = fct_infreq(primary_fuel))) +
  geom_bar()
```

Love it. But those fuel type names are tight, in some cases overlapping, making them unreadable. It would probably help to have this be a horizontal bar chart. To do that we make a change to the coordinate system. We call `coord_flip`:

```{r}
ggplot(d2, aes(x = fct_infreq(primary_fuel))) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()
```

Better! But notice what that did to the ordering. In a typical bar graph, you'll want to sort largest to smallest from top to bottom. To do this, we are going to add another similar tidyverse function, `fct_rev` which reverses the ordering of a factor. To do this, we'll pipe our `fct_infreq` expression into the `fct_rev` function.

We can do this in the initial ggplot call within the aes parameter. It would look like this: `ggplot(d1, aes(x = fct_infreq(primary_fuel) %>% fct_rev()))`. But frankly, when you do this it hurts the code's legibility. So, from this point onward, we are going to change up a key component of how we make the plot. By changing this, it will make the code somewhat more complex, but much easier to read and also easier to work with inside of our ggplot syntax. Basically, instead of having ggplot calculate a frequency table, we are going to do that ahead of time and then pipe that table into ggplot.

Remember your basic tidyverse piping rules! First we take the dataset, pipe that into a mutate statement to create the factor levels and then reverse them, and then we are going to pipe that into a `count()` function that will generate a frequency table, which is then piped into ggplot. Like so:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
d2 %>% 
  mutate(primary_fuel = fct_infreq(primary_fuel) %>% fct_rev()) %>% 
  count(primary_fuel)
```

Fine, but this then means we need to make two key changes to our ggplot syntax:

1)  We change the aesthetic call. Now we have both an X mapping to `primary_fuel` and a Y mapping to new variable created by the count function, `n`.
2)  We must change the geom_bar function. Its default stat is `count`, but now we have already done the counting outside of ggplot, so we must tell it to use a different stat. When we do NOT want it to apply any statistical transformation and to simply display the number that's in the data, we give it the stat **"identity."**

```{r}
d2 %>% 
  mutate(primary_fuel = fct_infreq(primary_fuel) %>% fct_rev()) %>% 
  count(primary_fuel) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(primary_fuel, n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip()
```

Excellent. Let's add some more detail here. We'll visually call out our non-renewable sources that come from fossil fuels. Let's create a new variable called `fossil_fuels` that is either **TRUE** or **FALSE** and then we'll give our fossil fuels a different color. So take the data and add that mutation to the piped tidyverse function. We then pipe that into ggplot, but here, we add an `aes` call in the `geom_bar` function, telling it to vary the fill aesthetic of the bar based on the value of the fossil_fuels variable.

```{r}
d2 %>% 
  mutate(primary_fuel = fct_infreq(primary_fuel) %>% fct_rev(),
         fossil_fuel = ifelse(primary_fuel %in% c("Coal", "Oil", "Petcoke"), TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  count(fossil_fuel, primary_fuel) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(primary_fuel, n, fill = fossil_fuel)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip()
```

Nice - there's one thing I don't like about this though. We are now duplicating code that we had previously - all that mutation business. Best practice in these instances is to assign that to an object that we can then call in the future, making your code much easier to read.

```{r}
p1 <- d2 %>% 
  mutate(primary_fuel = fct_infreq(primary_fuel) %>% fct_rev(),
         fossil_fuel = ifelse(primary_fuel %in% c("Coal", "Oil", "Petcoke"), TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  count(fossil_fuel, primary_fuel)

p1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(primary_fuel, n, fill = fossil_fuel)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip()
```

Love it. But let's change the colors up - the pink and blue aren't really helping us convey any useful information. We can change them by adding a `scale` adjustment for the fill aesthetic. We'll designate the colors manually instead of relying on a built-in color palette, and we'll choose black and green to represent fossil fuels versus non-fossil fuels .

```{r}
p1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(primary_fuel, n, fill = fossil_fuel)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("black", "green"))
```

Better, but problematic, because our fossil fuels are colored green and we certainly don't associate fossil fuels with the color green! (Always use color meaningfully!). The reason it did that is because when you are manually assigning fill values it will assign them in the order of the factored variable. In this case, since we did not specify the factor order when we created it, it defaults to alphabetical order. We could simply swap them in our code, but instead, we can just explicitly assign them in our `scale_fill_manual` call:

```{r}
p1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(primary_fuel, n, fill = fossil_fuel)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "black", "FALSE" = "green"))
```

Much better, though that's a terrible neon green - we'll fix that in our next go around.

What is still left to improve? The text. We aren't being told much about the chart. Let's add a `labs` function and label the title, both axes, and the legend. It is quite straightforward:

```{r}
p1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(primary_fuel, n, fill = fossil_fuel)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "grey", "FALSE" = "lightgreen")) +
  labs(title = "Count of US Power Plants by Fuel Type",
       x = "N",
       y  = "",
       fill = "Fossil Fuel")
```

Before we move on, notice something weird here? The labels x and y didn't act like they were flipped. Even though the `coord_flip` happens earlier, we still had to label as though it was based on the original ggplot call. This can get confusing, so I would suggest making the `coord_flip` one of the last things you do:

```{r}
p1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(primary_fuel, n, fill = fossil_fuel)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "grey", "FALSE" = "lightgreen")) +
  labs(title = "Count of US Power Plants by Fuel Type",
       x = "",
       y  = "N",
       fill = "Fossil Fuel") +
    coord_flip()
```

This is really coming together! It would be even better if we could label the actual bars with their values. To do so means adding a new geom, in this case `geom_text`. We want to add text to the visualization that will vary based on the `primary_fuel` and the `n` value. We add a new line of `geom_text` and we need to give it an aesthetic; for this particular geom we must designate the `label` aesthetic. We do NOT need to tell it the X aesthetic mapping since it is inheriting it from the initial ggplot call.

```{r}
p1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(primary_fuel, n, fill = fossil_fuel)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = n)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "grey", "FALSE" = "lightgreen")) +
  labs(title = "Count of US Power Plants by Fuel Type",
       x = "",
       y  = "N",
       fill = "Fossil Fuel") +
    coord_flip()
```

These need some cleaning up. I see two ways to clean these up:

1)  **Add commas where appropriate to the X axis labels and to the bar labels.** We do this by adding a call to the scale function inside of geom_text and for the continuous y axis. We call a function from the `scales` package that makes it easier to label things appropriately. When we want to reformat a vector of numbers like in our geom_text call, we use the `comma()` function (or `percent()` if you want to format it as a percentage). But when we want to format an axis, we have to use a slightly different function called `label_comma()` (or `label_percent()`).
2)  **Reposition the bar labels so they don't overlap the ends of the bars.** To do this, you should rely on the `hjust` parameter in your `geom_text` call - it stands for horizontal adjustment and a value of 1 will put it at the right most edge of the bar, a value of 0.1 will put it just to the right of the bar. Why? Honestly, I've never gotten a good answer on this. My hjust's always need trial and error to get them where I want them to be.
3)  **Reposition the bar labels so that they vary based on the length of the bars.**. Because the height of the bars varies so dramatically, we need to vary where they labels go. I'm going to do this with some trickery in the form of `ifelse()` statements and multiple `geom_text` calls. For bars that are greater than 1000, I'm having it do `hjust = 1`, and if below 1000, the `hjust = 0.1`

```{r}
p1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(primary_fuel, n, fill = fossil_fuel)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(n > 1000, comma(n), "")), hjust = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(n < 1000, comma(n), "")), hjust = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "grey", "FALSE" = "lightgreen")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(title = "Count of US Power Plants by Fuel Type",
       x = "",
       y  = "N",
       fill = "Fossil Fuel") +
    coord_flip()
```

That's a good looking bar chart!

Finally, now that we've got a really good bar chart, let's assume that we've been asked to show this data not as raw counts but as a percentages of all US power plants. We'll precalculate this number outside of ggplot by adding an `n()` function call to our count statement.

```{r}
p2 <- d2 %>% 
  mutate(primary_fuel = fct_infreq(primary_fuel) %>% fct_rev(),
         fossil_fuel = ifelse(primary_fuel %in% c("Coal", "Oil", "Petcoke"), TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  count(fossil_fuel, primary_fuel, total = n()) %>% 
  mutate(pct = round(n / total, 2))

p2
```

Then in ggplot, we simply change the assignment of the y variable in our initial call, and also the aesthetic mapping in our `geom_text`. We'll also need to change our number formatting to percentages.

```{r}
p2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(primary_fuel, pct, fill = fossil_fuel)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(pct > .01, percent(pct), "")), hjust = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(pct <= .01, percent(pct), "")), hjust = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "grey", "FALSE" = "lightgreen")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent()) +
  labs(title = "Count of US Power Plants by Fuel Type",
       x = "",
       y  = "N",
       fill = "Fossil Fuel") +
    coord_flip()
```

Well done! You now know how to make a fantastic looking bar chart.

### Pie Charts

After the bar, the other most common way to plot a single categorical variable is the much derided pie chart. As we've discussed I believe the pie chart can be useful so long as there are 3 or fewer categories, so for this demonstration let's visualize the distribution of fossil fuel power plants in the US.

I'm sure you've never thought about this before, but pie charts are actually just bar charts, but using a polar coordinate system. Let me show you, by first making a bar chart of the data we are interested in.

```{r}
pie1 <- d2 %>% 
  mutate(fossil_fuel = ifelse(primary_fuel %in% c("Coal", "Oil", "Petcoke"), TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  count(fossil_fuel) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = n, fill = fossil_fuel)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "grey", "FALSE" = "lightgreen"))


pie1
```

No surprises here. But now, let's simply take that bar chart and convert the coordinates to polar using `coord_polar`. I've also added a `theme_void` call because without it the default gives you some weird lines and shading (try it with that removed if you don't believe me).

```{r}
pie2 <- pie1 +
   coord_polar("y", start = 0) + 
   theme_void()

pie2
```

Let's clean this up with some labels. In order to make this a little easier, below I changed the fossil_fuel mutate statement so that instead of TRUE and FALSE values, I'm just giving them the labels I'll want in the plot. This means I need to also change the scale_fill_manual call.

But the big change is the geom_text line. Notice that I'm using string concatenation (`str_c()`) to put the values and the category labels together. I'm doing that within the aesthetic call because it will vary depending upon what we are visualizing. But outside of the aesthetic call, I'm assigning all of the labels the color white, setting their size to 4 and then using a new parameter called position. This tells the text call where to put the text, in this case telling it to stack the text and put it in the middle of the bar (or in this case, wedge) - `vjust` means vertically justify it in the center (halfway between 0 and 1). (This might make more sense if you remember that it still thinks it's a bar chart at this point).

```{r}
d1 %>% 
  mutate(fossil_fuel = ifelse(primary_fuel %in% c("Coal", "Oil", "Petcoke"), "Fossil Fuels", "Non-Fossil Fuels")) %>% 
  count(fossil_fuel) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = n, fill = fossil_fuel)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Fossil Fuels" = "grey", "Non-Fossil Fuels" = "lightgreen")) +
  labs(title = "US Power Plants by Fuel Type") +
  geom_text(aes(label = str_c(fossil_fuel, "\n", comma(n))), color = "white", size = 4, 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

### Waffle Charts

Don't eat dessert? How about breakfast? Here's a quick look at the pie chart's sibling, the waffle chart. These are especially helpful when you want to show frequencies at a scale that's more human comprehensible. In other words, I prefer these for when I want the user to think in terms of raw numbers rather than proportions or percentages (even if I want them thinking X out of 100). You may have seen visualizations like this before:

-   If the world were 100 people, 15 of them would be X.
-   A viz where each square represents 1000 liters.

There is a special library for this that you'll first have to install, and then load called `waffle`. Once we have that, the key thing we'll need to do is figure out how we want to scale our data for the visualization.

Let's visualize the number of fossil fuel plants in the US compared to the non-fossil fuel plants. To do this, we'll create a waffle chart where each square = 100 power plants. That will be our scale factor, by which we will divide our count of power plants.

Once we have that we'll call `geom_waffle` and designate the number of rows = 10 Why 10? Well, with the 100 scale factor, there will be a total of 98 boxes to visualize. By picking 10, it will get us the closest to having a square 10x10 plot. I'm setting `flip = T` so that the variables fill from bottom to top rather than left to right. We add a few other parameter calls on size and color, and then add a subtitle label which indicates "1 square = 100 Power Plants" and we are good to go!

```{r}
# install.packages("waffle")
library(waffle)

scale_factor <- 100  # Adjust the scale factor as needed

d2 %>% 
  mutate(fossil_fuel = ifelse(primary_fuel %in% c("Coal", "Oil", "Petcoke"), "Fossil Fuels", "Non-Fossil Fuels")) %>% 
  count(fossil_fuel) %>%
  mutate(scaled_count = round(n / scale_factor)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = fossil_fuel, values = scaled_count)) +
  geom_waffle(
    n_rows = 10,
    size = 0.33, 
    colour = "white",
    flip = T
  ) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "US Power Plants by Fuel Type",
       subtitle = "1 square = 100 Power Plants",
       fill = "Fossil Fuels")
```

### Tree Map

An alternative to a pie chart and a waffle chart is a tree map. Unlike pie charts, but like a waffle chart, it can handle categorical variables that have many levels. Here again, we have a dedicated library that can be used to easily create one, `treemapify` with the associated `geom_treemap`. This can be used with either raw counts or percentages - below we'll use percentages.

```{r}
library(treemapify)

d2 %>% 
  mutate(primary_fuel = fct_infreq(primary_fuel) %>% fct_rev(),
         fossil_fuel = ifelse(primary_fuel %in% c("Coal", "Oil", "Petcoke"), TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  count(fossil_fuel, primary_fuel, total = n()) %>% 
  mutate(pct = n / total) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = primary_fuel, area = pct)) +
  geom_treemap() + 
  labs(title = "Power Plants by Fuel Type") 
```

This is interesting, but without any direct labeling on the chart, this is as bad as an overloaded pie chart. Here is a much more useful version with labels, in which we can see it's superiority to a pie chart. Notice the concatenation I'm doing in the `geom_treemap_text` call to get the label displaying exactly what I want:

```{r}
d2 %>% 
  mutate(primary_fuel = fct_infreq(primary_fuel) %>% fct_rev(),
         fossil_fuel = ifelse(primary_fuel %in% c("Coal", "Oil", "Petcoke"), TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  count(fossil_fuel, primary_fuel, total = n()) %>% 
  mutate(pct = round(100 *(n / total), 1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = primary_fuel, area = pct)) +
  geom_treemap() + 
  geom_treemap_text(aes(label = str_c(primary_fuel, " ", pct, "%")), color = "white", 
                    place = "center", reflow = T) +
  labs(title = "Power Plants by Fuel Type") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Variable Understanding: Continuous Variables

Now let's focus on understanding our continuous variables. Let's see what we have available to us by going back to that sapply function, but look specifically for numeric variables:

```{r}
names(d2)[sapply(d2, class) == "numeric"]
```

The `capacity_mw` and `generation_gwh_2019` look to be the most interesting - how much can the plant generate and how much did it actually generate in 2019? Let's focus our investigation on the former.

### Histogram

The simplest visualization for a numeric variable and indeed the one that is most helpful when we are doing exploratory data analysis is the histogram. A histogram divides the x-axis into equally spaced bins and then uses the height of a bar to display the number of observations that fall in each bin.

Creating one is simple - you set the X aesthetic (undeclared) to `capacity_mw` and then you call `geom_histogram`:

```{r}
ggplot(d2, aes(capacity_mw)) +
   geom_histogram()
```

The tallest bar shows that roughly 8000 observations are clustered around the lowest possible MW capacity. This is likely a function of how many different types of power plants there are in the dataset, covering everything from very tiny solar arrays to massive nuclear stations. Let's get something more useful by filtering to a specific type of fuel:

```{r}
d2 %>% 
  filter(primary_fuel == "Wind") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(capacity_mw)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Looking at just wind farms, we have a much more interesting and useful visualization. Note that the histogram defaulted to 30 "bins" of the data. You can rerun the histogram with a different number of bins OR you can designate the bin width. This could really change the "look" of the data, so you should always try a bunch of different bin numbers or bin widths, because it could reveal different patterns. Let's look for a "smoother" shape by having the histogram split the wind farms into deciles, telling it to give us only 10 bins.

```{r}
d2 %>% 
  filter(primary_fuel == "Wind") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(capacity_mw)) +
   geom_histogram(bins = 10)
```

You can of course clean these up if you like, working the `lab` function and changing some of the colors and or labels. But especially when you are just using these for EDA, you won't have any cause to make big formatting changes.

### Density Plot

If we really are looking for a "smoother" visualization we can just turn this into a density plot, which is in essence a smoothed version of a histogram where the area under the curve equals one. This is most useful as an alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.

Changing this to a density plot is as easy as changing the geom, and if you like you can give it a fill color.

```{r}
d2 %>% 
  filter(primary_fuel == "Wind") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(capacity_mw)) +
   geom_density(fill = "green")
```

### Boxplots

Looking for something nerdier? Something a little more information dense? Boxplots are odd, but can be incredibly useful (invented by Tukey, remember). Here's a great description of how they work. The box itself represents the interquartile range, running from the 25th %tile to the 75th %tile, with the bar in the middle representing the median. The whiskers extend out to the farthest non-outlier point. And outliers are shown as dots.

Creating one means changing the geom to `geom_boxplot` but keeping the aesthetic statement the same. I've also called `coord_flip` below because to my eyes having the boxplot run vertically is just a more intuitive way to look at the plot than horizontal. But that's just a personal preference.

```{r}
d2 %>% 
  filter(primary_fuel == "Wind") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(capacity_mw)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```

Boxplots are rarely used when communicating results to those with no statistical background; you'll mostly be using them for EDA.

### Dotplots

Finally, dotplots are sort of the hybrid between a waffle chart and a histogram, in which each dot has spot on the X axis designated by numeric data, and the dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation.  Think of 538's Senate prediction [plots]<https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/>

They can be used to great effect when you have a limited number of observations for a numeric variable. Consider the example below, in which we take the full global dataset and count the number of nuclear power plants that each country has. We then display a dotplot of the number of countries that are at each count of nuclear plants (1, 2, 3, etc).

This is done with `geom_dotplot` and a few fixed parameters to give it some visual interest. I'm removing everything to do with the y axis because as the help article says for this geom:

> When binning along the x axis and stacking along the y axis, the numbers on y axis are not meaningful, due to technical limitations of ggplot2. You can hide the y axis, as in one of the examples, or manually scale it to match the number of dots.

```{r}
d1 %>% 
  filter(primary_fuel == "Nuclear") %>% 
  count(country) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n)) +
  geom_dotplot(fill = "darkred", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Nuclear Power Plants per Country",
       x = "Number of Nuclear Power Plants") +
  theme(
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "none"
  )
```

There is also a parameter option where you can set `stackdir = center` that gives the visualization some added visual interest:

```{r}
d1 %>% 
  filter(primary_fuel == "Nuclear") %>% 
  count(country) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n)) +
  geom_dotplot(stackdir = "center", fill = "darkred", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Nuclear Power Plants per Country",
       x = "Number of Nuclear Power Plants") +
  theme(
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "none"
  )
```
