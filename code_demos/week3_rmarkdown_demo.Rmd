```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

We need to install Latex on your computer.  This will allow you to compile your R Markdown reports into PDF files.  Just run the below two lines of code to download and install Latex onto your computer and make it accessible to RStudio.  (This may take a while since there are a lot of files to download, so have a little patience here - and remember that you only have to do this once.)

```{r}
# install.packages("tinytex")
# tinytex::install_tinytex() #install tiny tex
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can type out those backticks manually, but you can automatically insert a code chunk in one of two ways: 1) go to the "Code" menu and the first option is "Insert Chunk", or 2) you can use the keyboard shortcut for "Insert Chunk" which is Cmd-Option-i on Macs

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.  The default is to print the code AND show the output.


## Formatting Text

This is just normal written text in an RMarkdown file. There 's nothing special about this. This is normal paragraph text.

You can start a new paragraph just by hitting enter and putting in a blank line.

If you want text in *italics* or **bold** you need to mark that with either `*one*` or `**two**` asterisks on either side.

If you want text to include `verbatim code` you should surround it with one backtick on both sides.

You can do superscripts^1^ surrounding text with carets (\^) or subscripts~1~ by surrounding texts with tildes (\~).

Endashs -- are two minus signs, emdashes --- are three minus signs.

> A block quote is preceded by a greater than sign. A block quote is preceded by a greater than sign. A block quote is preceded by a greater than sign. A block quote is preceded by a greater than sign. A block quote is preceded by a greater than sign.

# Different Levels of Header

## Are preceded with increasing

### Numbers of pound signs (hashtags#)

You can make bullet lists. Put a blank line after paragraph of text. Then, on the next line, use an asterisks (\*) for the top bullet. For sub-items, on a new line, press tab and then use a plus sign (+). For sub-sub items, press tab twice and use a minus sign (-)

* My bullets
  + sub-item 1
      - sub-sub-item 1


For numbered lists, start the number list item with a number followed by a period (1.)

1.  Number 1
2.  Number 2


| Right | Left | Default | Center |
|------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
|   You | can  | make    |   a    |
| table | by   | hand    |  but   |
|    it | is   | clunky  |   .    |
